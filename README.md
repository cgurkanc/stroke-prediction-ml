A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted, leading to damage or death of brain cells. The risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, obesity, family history of stroke, and previous history of stroke or heart disease.

Stroke prediction models use a combination of risk factors to estimate an individual's likelihood of having a stroke within a certain time frame. These models can be helpful in guiding prevention and treatment strategies, such as lifestyle modifications, medication management, and close monitoring for early signs of stroke.

This refers to the use of machine learning algorithms and techniques to develop models for predicting an individual's risk of having a stroke based on various factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status, and other medical history. Machine learning algorithms can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns and correlations that can be used to make predictions with a high degree of accuracy. These models can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals who may be at high risk for stroke and implementing preventive measures
